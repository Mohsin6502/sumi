<p>So, Sumaiya this isn’t a storybook confession. <br>This is real. Raw. And written with nothing but love.<br> I don’t want anything from you except your happiness.<br> But if even a small part of your heart ever feels what mine does,<br>give us a chance. A gentle, honest, forever-kind-of chance.<br> Because I’d choose you, in every lifetime, with every version of me.<br> And I’d still fall in love with you again and again.🫶🫶🫶🫶</p>

<div class="paper image">
  <p class="p2">I know trust doesn’t come easy for you.<br> I know your past has been heavy.<br> But I’m not here to be perfect—I’m here to be present. To listen. To hold space. <br>To never make you feel like you’re “too much.”<br> You’re not hard to love you just haven’t been loved gently enough. Let me be the one who show<br>s you what patience looks like, what softness feels like,<br> what love can be when it's real.🥰</p>

<div class="paper image">
<p class="p1">You’ve been my quiet guide, without even trying. <BR>Your small reminders, your thoughtful words,<BR> your belief in me—even when I lost belief in myself—meant more than you know. <BR>You never asked to be my support system, but you became one.<BR>You helped me grow in faith, in character, and in heart. <BR>You led me back to myself… and closer to Allah. <BR>That alone, is something I will cherish forever.😭</p>

<div class="paper">
<p>From the very beginning, there was something about you that felt different something rare. <BR>I didn’t just fall for your smile or your voice (though they’re unforgettable), I fell for your heart. <BR>The way you carry strength in silence, the kindness behind your eyes,<BR> and the way you hold so much beauty even in the parts of yourself you hide. <BR>You don’t even realize how easy you are to love—genuinely, deeply, and without conditions. 😍 </p>
